* SPHinXsys (pronunciation: s'finksis) is an acronym from Smoothed Particle	*
* Hydrodynamics for industrial compleX systems. It provides C++ APIs for	*
* physical accurate simulation and aims to model coupled industrial dynamic *
* systems including fluid, solid, multi-body dynamics and beyond with SPH	*
* (smoothed particle hydrodynamics), a meshless computational method using	*
* particle discretization.													*

 * @brief 	This is the base classes of SPH bodies. The real body is for 
 *			that with cell linked list and the fictitious one does not.     
 * 			Before the definition of the SPH bodies, the shapes with complex 
 *			geometries, i.e. those are produced by advanced binary operation, 
 * 			such as intersection, should be produced first.
 * 			Then, all shapes used in body definition should be either contain 
 * 			or not contain each other. 
 *			Partial overlap between them are not premitted.
